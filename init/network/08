# Find the provider of slash16.org

# Ok, there are 3 steps to find provider of the website (who hosts it).
# 1) Use ping to find the IP address.
# 2) Use WHOIS to find the host information.
# 3) Use a dedicated service to look up details.

# Ping — A tool that will return the IP address of the web server:
ping slash16.org

# In the case with slash16.org, the result is 13.32.118.193
# WHOIS — A lookup that can tell who is hosting my domain, where it was
# registered and what the Domain Name Server is.
# Let's get to the http://whoisinfo.guru/ip-whois/ and check the ip we got
# from ping. 
# We can see from 'Organization' field that ip belongs to Amazon Technologies Inc.

# Alternatively (without googling):
# nslookup slash16.org | grep "Address"
# take the ip and use it as [whois ip] 
# We can see from 'Organization' field that ip belongs to Amazon Technologies Inc.
